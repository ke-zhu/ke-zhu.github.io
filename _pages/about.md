I'm Ke Zhu, a Postdoctoral Research Scholar with affiliations at both [North Carolina State University](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/kzhu24/) and [Duke University](https://biostat.duke.edu/profile/ke-zhu). Before this, I obtained my PhD degree from Tsinghua University under the guidance of Dr. [Hanzhong Liu](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/teachers/hanzhongliu/). Currently, I'm working under the mentorship of Dr. [Shu Yang](https://shuyang.wordpress.ncsu.edu) and Dr. [Xiaofei Wang](https://biostat.duke.edu/profile/xiaofei-wang), delving into the utilization of real-world data (RWD) to enhance the efficiency and robustness of clinical trials. I'm also passionate about the design and analysis of complex experiments, utilizing resampling methods like bootstrap, randomization tests, and rerandomization.
