I’m Ke Zhu, a Postdoctoral Research Scholar jointly affiliated with [North Carolina State University](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/kzhu24/) and [Duke University](https://biostat.duke.edu/profile/ke-zhu). I completed my PhD at Tsinghua University under the guidance of Dr. [Hanzhong Liu](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/teachers/hanzhongliu/). Currently, I am mentored by Dr. [Shu Yang](https://shuyang.wordpress.ncsu.edu) and Dr. [Xiaofei Wang](https://biostat.duke.edu/profile/xiaofei-wang), focusing on utilizing real-world data (RWD) to enhance the efficiency and robustness of causal inference in clinical trials. My research interests include the design and analysis of complex experiments, randomization inference, and high-dimensional statistics.
